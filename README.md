# Pastry Panic

### Synopsis

Four sinners who have been transformed into breakfast pastries upon eternal damnation try to escape from the 9th Circle of Hell. You and three other friends play as these backstabbing pastries. Treachery and betrayal got you here - treachery and betrayal can get you out. A game of teamwork and betrayal utilizing and adapting the "Prisoner's Dilemma" for four players. Press "m" to chat. Hamachi or Evolve recommended (for port forwarding purposes). Our rap track is fire.
